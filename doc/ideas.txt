My research Idea is how we do we test how much caffine someone can consume to code properly.
We can test this easily by just giving them some caffine and see how effective they are at coding.
We would want to make sure they get the same amount of sleep and the same diet everyday.
We don't want those outside factors to effect our test. Instead we want the amount of caffine to be
our primary variable.
